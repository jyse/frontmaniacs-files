  Part 1: Building a Smart Contract: 
  In Remix & Solidity 101 

*************************************************************************************************************

=======> Remix setup <=======

Step 1
💠 Open up Remix IDE
👉 www.remix-project.org
👉 Click on Remix IDE
❗ Make sure your Metamask is pinned to this browser you are using for Remix!

Step 2
💠 Use Frontmaniacs.sol in Remix
👉 In you starter files, go to smart contracts folder and open Frontmaniacs.sol
👉 Copy the Frontmaniacs.sol contract 
👉 Go back to Remix 
👉 Click on the contracts folder with right mouse click
👉 Select a new file and name it Frontmaniacs.sol 
👉 Paste your code into the code editor
👀 You will see packages coming up on your left 

Step 3
💠 Setup Remix
👉 In the left bar, go to the Solidity Compiler section
👉 switch Auto compile on
👉 Click on the chevron next to Advanced configurations and switch on Enable Optimization

Step 4
💠 What is Remix? A tour
👉  a online IDE where you can create, manage, execute and deploy your smart contracts
👉 If you go to the Deploy and Run Transactions section via the left bar, 
You can see there are different environments, where we can test and deploy your contracts!
These are like little blockchains environments we can use!
 👉The local VM London will have his own account but if you use the Injected Provider, that’s when Metamask will be used! Like this - with the Goerli (5) network and so your Metamask account shows up like here
 👉 you can send ETH through this 
😃 And yes, we are all going to be doing this so get excited!

=======> Coding a smart contract <=======

💠 Step 1: Deploy a contract locally on VM Remix (London)
👉 First compile your contract and fix errors 
👉 Go to the section Deploy & Run transactions on the left side 
👉 Make sure Remix VM (London), the local machine  is selected 
👉 Select the right contract - Frontmaniacs.sol
👉 Make sure your terminal is visible on the right bottom side
👉 And hit Deploy
👀 It should come up under Deployed contracts 
👉 click upon the chevron to unfold this contract 
👀 you see all the functions of the contract, including safeMint

💠 Step 2: safeMint() locally on VM Remix (London)
👉  Click safeMint
👀 and on the right side you can see that you’ve minted a NFT!

💠 Step 3: Try out balanceOf, ownerOf, tokenURI functions after using safeMint()
👉 Copy your account address
❌ Do NOT deploy your contract again! 
👉 Paste your account address as parameter in the balanceOf function
👉 and call the balanceOf()
👀 It should be visible that you’ve minted 1 NFT ⇒ uint256: 1
⏯️ You can play with it by clicking safeMint() again and calling balanceOf again
👉 At ownerOf() insert a zero as tokenId since this is your first NFT
👉 call ownerOf() and 
👀 you’ll see your account address given by VM Remix (London) local environment
👉 at tokenURI insert a zero as tokenId and call the function
👀 You’ll get a link to the tokenID which is a JSON object that holds the link to the image and properties of the NFT. 

💠 Step 4: Make the safeMint function payable
👉 add payable keyword next to public in the function
👉 write require(msg.value >= ether, “more money needed”)

💠 Step 5: Ethereum Metric System
👉 go to this site: https://eth-converter.com/

💠 Step 6: use safeMint again without value 
👉 Compile your contract and fix errors if needed
👉 Go to Deploy & Run Transactions section
❗ Remove your previous contract under Deployed contracts 
❗ Make sure you are on Remix VM London
👉 Hit Deploy
👉 Hit safeMint() 
👀 It will give you….what?
❌ Which error message did you get?
👉👉 This will give you an error because you’re not sending any ETH! 
👀 Look up Value in the Deploy & Run Transactions section
👉 Go to the: 🌐 https://eth-converter.com/
👉 Convert 0.01 ether and copy paste the value in GWEI - which is 1 with 7 0’s
👉 Go back to Remix and to the Deploy & Run Transactions section
👉 Paste that into Value in the Deploy & Run Transactions section
❗Select the GWEI unit as your Ethereum unit!! 
👉 Click safeMint
👀 You should see on the right the amount converted into WEI
🥳 Congratulations! You have minted your first NFT with ETH on a local blockchain!

💠 Step 7: add the totalSupply function to the safeMint Function
👉 require(totalSupply() >= maxSupply, “You have reached the limit”) 

❗🦊 In case you haven not installed Metamask yet, connected it to Goerli Testnet Network and have gotten an Alchemy account to get GoerliETH through www.goerlifaucet.com, 
Do that first!! 🦊❗

💠 Step 8: Deploy this contract to the Goerli Testnet Network - INSTALL METAMASK
📝 You need your Metamask installed and pinned to the browser you’re using for Remix. 
👉 Show / hide test networks - turn that on 
👉 You need to have your Metamask installed 
🦊 Go to your Metamask: 
👉 Click the network at the top and then click on show / hide test networks - turn that on 
👉 And then select the Goerli test network 
🌐 Go to www.goerlifaucet.com 
👉 Make an account on alchemy.com
👉 Copy your account address
👉 And get some TEST ETH of 0.1 to test things out 

💠 Step 9: Deploy this contract to the Goerli Testnet Network
👉 Go back to Remix 
👉 Compile and fix errors
👉 Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions section 
❗Select another environment: the Injected Provider - Metamask
👀 You will see the Goerli network coming up and your account address of your Metamask
👉 Make sure the right contract is selected 
❗Remove your previous deployed contract below
👉 Hit deploy 
👀 🦊Metamask will pop up! Confirm
👉 And click on ‘view on etherscan’ in your terminal 
👀 Goerli Etherscan: you can see a contract creation now as a transaction on the Goerli Testnet Network 
🧘‍♀️You have to wait a little bit….for the contract to be created
👉 You’ll see at the “To:” section the contract address, click upon it.
👉 Here you can see the contract and everything that happens in and around it.
❗❗Let this browser page open or save this URL somewhere!
👉 💥 You’re going to need that Contract address at the top, so copy that and save it somewhere

💠 Step 10: use safeMint and mint a NFT to the Goerli network
👉 Go back to remix
❌ Go to the Deploy and Run Transactions section
👉 Look up Value and add a value of 1 + 7 0’s and select the unit GWEI 
👀 Make sure to check that!
❌❗DO NOT RE-DEPLOY YOUR CONTRACT!!! DO NOT HIT DEPLOY!!
👉 pop your contract open at the Deployed contracts
👉 click on safeMint
🦊 Your Metamask will ask for 0.01 GoerliETH! So confirm
👀 On the right bottom in your terminal, you’ll see a link “view on etherscan”
 👉click on view on etherscan 
🧘‍♀️ Takes some time…..
👀 At etherscan, you’ll see at Tokens Transfer that your mint is coming up 
 👉Click on the contract address and BOOM! There’s your safeMint transaction with a value of 0.01 ETH! 
🥳 We have now deployed and minted a NFT on the Goerli Testnet Network!

❗❗❗ Do not close REMIX or your contract address page!! <<<
