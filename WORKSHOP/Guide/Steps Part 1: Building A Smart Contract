  Part 1: Building a Smart Contract: 
  In Remix & Solidity 101 

*****************************************************************
Step 1: 
💠 Get your Solidity contract 



Step 1
💠 Open up Remix IDE
👉 www.remix-project.org
👉 Click on Remix IDE
❗ Make sure your Metamask is pinned to this browser you are using for Remix!

Step 2
💠 Setup Remix
👉 select Auto compile 
👉 Advanced configurations > select Enable Optimization

Step 4
💠 Introduction of Solidity
💻 license always at the top 
💻 always a version of solidity at the top 
💻 imports so you can use different kinds of standards of contracts 
💻 contract word is like a class and “is ERC721”, means that this contract inherits functionality from the ERC721 and is like it. 
💻 for variables types are always used, like string or an unsigned integer whereby 256 represents that this integer will take up 256 bits of space in memory. 
💻 if you see something with the word using - it means: using A for B, it means that we attach every function from library A in this case Counters, to type B Counter.
💻 Counters is then used to set the _tokenIdCounter which is a private variable 
💻 constructor, is like a classic constructor and to make this contract with the name of Frontmaniacs and the symbol token you see very often on OpenSea. 
💻 private, internal or public all have to do with the accessibility of the function - how much you can see or retrieve from the blockchain. 
💻 string memory means, this string comes back from a temporary memory - so this won’t cost so much gas fees - or not at all. 

Step 5
💠 safeMint-function of ERC721 
👉 Example of ERC721 in your WORKSHOP > smart contracts > Examples

Step 6
💠 Deploy the contract locally in Remix 
👉 First compile your contract and fix errors 
👉 Go to the section Deploy & Run transactions on the left side 
👉 Make sure Remix VM (London) is selected - 📝 this is your local environment
👉 Select the right contract - Frontmaniacs.sol
👉 And hit Deploy
👉 It should come up under Deployed contracts 
👉 Unfold this menu and you see all the functions of the contract, including safeMint
👉 Click safeMint
💥 And then you see on the right side that you’ve minted a NFT locally on the VM London

💠 Use the balanceOf and ownerOf function 🚀
📝 Note: Remix is a local blockchain with your own account (not Metamask!)
👉 Copy your account address from 
👉 check the functionality of balanceOf and OwnerOf. 
👉 At ownerOf you fill in as tokenId 0, since this was your first time minting
❓ What do you see? 

//////Check this tokenURI function
💠 the tokenURI function
👉 Now that you have minted a NFT 
👉 Try to retrieve the URI of tokenId 0 
👉 Look at the JSON-object and try to retrieve the image in the browser by using the hash
📝 https://ipfs.io/ipfs/ <hash> / <image>

💠 Make the safeMint function a payable function
📝 In order to use msg.value, you need to use payable in your function

💠 Add a requirement of msg.value <= 0.01 ether
📝 requirements functions like a "if else break statement"
👉 Go to the Ethereum Unit Converter: https://eth-converter.com/
📝 Solidity does not take any float numbers and under the hood everything gets converted to WEI (smallest unit)
👉 Deploy your contract again
❗ Make sure to remove the previous contract before you do!
//////// Add in steps to add VALUE and send eth

💠 Add a requirement of totalSupply() <= maxSupply
📝 You can use other functions from other contracts (e.g. like ERC1155) in your contract of standard ERC721
👉 add in requirement that totalSupply() has to be smaller and/or equal to maxSupply or else message: "You've reached a limit!" 

-- Alchemy account 
-- Metamask show/hide 
-- Metamask get Test ETH

💠 Deploy this contract to the Goerli Testnet Network! 
❗ You need to have your Metamask installed and pin it to your browser! 
👉 Find Settings in Metamask and click on Show / hide test networks to switch that on 
👉 And then select the Goerli test network 
👉 Go to www.goerlifaucet.com 
👉 Copy your account address
👉 And get some TEST ETH of 0.1 to test things out 
🍀 You got some ETH? Let's go!
👉 Go back to Remix 
👉 Compile and fix errors
👉 Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions section 
👉 Select another environment: ❗The Injected Provider - Metamask
👉 You will see the Goerli network coming up and your account address is the same as in your Metamask
👉 Make sure the right contract (Frontmaniacs.sol) is selected 
👉 Remove your previous deployed contract below
👉 Hit deploy 
🍀 Metamask will pop up! Confirm - could be that this has to be done twice
👀 On the right you see ‘view on etherscan’ in your terminal, click on it!
👀 We can see a creation of contract right now on the Goerli Testnet Network 
👉 Click on the contract address in the middle 
👉 Now you're at the contract page where you can see all transactions happening of which the first is contract creation. 
❗❗ Copy the URL in the browser of your contract page: VERY IMPORTANT
❗❗ Every time you change your contract in the meantime, you need to deploy it again and also copy this URL!

💠 Let’s deploy the safeMint to the Goerli network! 
👉 Go back to Remix 
👉 Make sure the environment is: the Injected Provider - Metamask
👉 Now add a value of 10000000 (1 with 7 zero’s) and select GWEI (!!!) 
👉 Pop this contract open  
👉 And click on safeMint 
🍀 Metamask will pop up!
👉 Click on view on etherscan 
👉 At Tokens transferred you’ll your mint coming up 
👉 And click on the contract address, there you see your safeMint as a transaction! 
👉 

🥳 Celebration
❗🤩🌟 We have deployed our first contract AND minted our first NFT there!
